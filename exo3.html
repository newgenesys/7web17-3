        What does the following expression return?  3 + 2; /*3 is a number and 2is a number carrying out the addition operator on them results to another number 5*/

W. does the following expression return? typeof (3);/*number*/

W. does the following expression return? typeof (3) === typeof (4.32);/*3 is a nunber 4.32 is a number but their types are different 3 is an interger while 4.32 is a float hence 3 is not thesame as 4.32 */

What does the following expression return? 5 / 0;/*infinity because anything divided by zero is an errow called infinty*/

Whet does the 'following expression return? 3 / 'bob;/*3 is a number and bob is a string the /is used for escaping the character*/

What does the following expression return? NaN === NaN;/*false because they are not necessarily thesame non-numbers*/ 

What does the following expression return? typeof (NaN);/*number  because the datatype used to hold it is a number*/

What does the following expression return? isNaN(NaN):/*true NaN does not work properly with non values*/

What does the following expression .urn? Math.pow(2, 3);/*
return=8
the Math.pow()inbuild method evaluates the exponent of 2 to the power 3 e.g 2*2*2=8

Describe how the following expression assigns a variable to a value. var first_name = "cindy";/*by the usage of the assignment operator =*/

What is the value of the hello variable in the following expression? var hello;/*undefined because no assignment operator has been used to assigne it a value*/

What does the following .pression return? var y; y === "cool";/*false because we dont know the value of y and this is a comparism between y and the string "cool"in which we need to compare both the type and value.*/

What does the following expression return? "some" + " person";/*some person the two strings are concatenated .the +sign in strings concatenates and has priority*/

What does the following expression return?/*the return is Bart Simpson this is a concatenation of first and last with a whitespace""*/

> var first = "Bart"

 var last = "Simpson";

> first " "+ last

What does the following expression return? "cool".length;/*the return is 4 because "cool" has 4 characters and the .lenth method operator gives the number of characters a string has*/ 

What does the following expression return? Explain the answer. "phat" === "phat";/* the return is true they are of thesame value and have thesame datatype the strict comparism value === converts the string tp boolean and compares them.*/

What does the following expression return? typeof("cats");/*the return is string,the typeof() method determines the data type and since the word "cat" is written in quotes it is then confirmed a string*/

What does the following expression return? 3 + "bob"/*return is 3bob ,here type coercion occurs where the string is first interpreted as a number*/

Round the number 4.87 to the nearest integer./* Math.round(4.87)
return=5 which is the nearest interger.*/

Divide the number 6 by the string "2" and explain the result./*return is 3,because the string "2 " is interpreted as a number due to type coercion .Applying the division operator to 6/2 yields 3.*/

What does the following expression return? Explain the result. 3 * "bob";/*return is NaN because the multiplication of a string and a number does not make sense hence multiplicaction operator does not apply to a string*/

Declare the variables x and y./*
var x;
var y;
var hobby="programming"


Set the variable hobby to the string "programming'.*/

What does the following expression return?

var sport; sport === undefined/* true because sport has not been assigned a value using the assignment operator=,comparing the sport variable with undefined will result in a boolean which is true*/

Demonstrate that "brogrammer" has the type "string". (edited) /* 
typeof("brogrammer")
return="string"*/
