    <h2> 1.) Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a number. In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120</h2> 

 	<h2> 2.) Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.</h2> 

 	<h2>  3.) Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers. Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.</h2>
